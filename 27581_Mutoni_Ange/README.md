## What I Did
- Cloned the repository from GitHub. 
- Created a new branch with the correct naming convention. 
- Built the directory structure: `Practice`, `Command`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `Here`, `Else`, `Hi`.  
- Added files: 
  - `info` (executable) 
  - `Hello` (executable) 
  - `hereWeAre` (regular file) 
- Wrote all the commands required for the 6 assignment questions inside `assignment1.txt`. 
- Collected screenshots of the important steps.

## Why I Did It
The purpose was to practice **Linux basic commands** and understand: 
- The difference between absolute and relative paths. 
- The use of `ls -l` for directory listings. 
- How to copy files vs directories. 
- How Linux color codes help identify file types.

## What I Learned
- **Relative vs Absolute Paths:** Relative depends on current location, Absolute always starts from `/`.  
- **`ls -l`:** Provides details like permissions, ownership, size, and date. 
- **Copying:** `cp -r directory` copies whole directories, while `cp directory/*` copies only the contents.  
- **Linux Colors:** 
  - Blue = directories 
  - Yellow = executable files 
  - White = normal files (green if executable)
