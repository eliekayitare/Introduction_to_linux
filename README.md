# Assignment 1 â€“ Linux Basic Commands

## What I Did
- Cloned the repository from GitHub.
- Created a new branch named `26295_MUHIRE_Blande_assignment1`.
- Practiced Linux navigation (`cd`, `ls`), file copying (`cp`), recursive means also that file inside the directory will be included  (`-r `) and path usage (relative vs absolute).
- Documented commands and included screenshots of outputs.

## Why I Did It
- To understand and learn Linux filesystem navigation.
- To learn the difference between relative and absolute paths.
- To practice file management in Linux (copying single files vs multiple files).

## What I Learned
- How to use relative vs absolute paths effectively.
- How to list files with detailed information using `ls -l`.
- The difference between copying a single file and all files in a directory.
- How Linux terminal colors indicate file types (blue for directories, yellow for executables, etc.).
