# Assignment 1 â€“ Introduction to Linux

## What I Did
In this assignment, I worked on basic Linux commands to navigate the filesystem, list directory contents, and copy files. Specifically, I practiced:
- Moving between directories using both relative and absolute paths.
- Listing directory contents in long format.
- Copying files and directories using relative and absolute paths.
- Comparing the difference between copying a single file and copying all files from a directory.
- Understanding the meaning of different colors used when listing files in Linux.

## Why I Did It
The purpose of this assignment was to build a strong foundation in Linux command-line usage. These commands are essential because:
- They allow efficient navigation and manipulation of files without relying on a graphical interface.
- They are universally applicable across different Linux distributions and servers.
- They form the basis for advanced tasks like scripting, automation, and system administration.

## What I Learned
Through this assignment, I learned:
- How to differentiate between relative and absolute paths.
- How to use the `ls -l` command to view detailed information about files and directories.
- The syntax and usage of the `cp` command for copying files and directories.
- The difference between copying a single file and copying all files from a directory.
- How Linux uses color coding in the terminal to represent different types of files (e.g., directories, executables, symbolic links).

This assignment helped me become more confident with Linux basics and prepared me for more advanced command-line operations in the future.
