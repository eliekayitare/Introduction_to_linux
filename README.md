Exercises Completed
1. Path Navigation

From P3 directory to home:

    Relative path: cd ../../..

    Absolute path: cd /home/mcbishop

2. File Listing

Long listing of Here directory:

    From Command directory (relative): ls -l ../Practice/Here

    Absolute path: ls -l /home/mcbishop/Practice/Here

3. File Copy Operations

Copy file P3 to Command directory:

    From P2: cp ../P3/P3 ../Command/

    From P3: cp P3 ../Command/

    From Command: cp ../P3/P3 .

    Absolute path: cp /home/mcbishop/Practice/Eise/P3/P3 /home/mcbishop/Practice/Command/

Copy files from P3 to Command directory:

    From P2: cp ../P3/* ../Command/

    From P3: cp * ../Command/

    From Command: cp ../P3/* .

    Absolute path: cp /home/mcbishop/Practice/Eise/P3/* /home/mcbishop/Practice/Command/

4. Conceptual Understanding

    Difference between file operations: Single file copy vs multiple files copy using wildcards

    Linux color coding: Blue for directories, yellow for device files
