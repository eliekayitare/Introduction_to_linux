# Assignment 1 â€“ Introduction to Linux Basic Commands


## ðŸ”¹ What I Did
1. **Cloned the Repository**  
   - Used the command:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/eliekayitare/Introduction_to_linux.git
     ```
   - This gave me access to the assignment files.

2. **Created My Branch**  
   - Followed the required naming format:  
     ```bash
     git checkout -b 27283_Muyoboke-herve_assignment1
     ```

3. **Worked on the Linux Commands**  
   - Answered all the questions by writing commands for:
     - Navigating between directories.  
     - Showing long listings.  
     - Copying files and directories using relative and absolute paths.  

4. **Created Documentation**  
   - Added this `README.md` file.  
   - Wrote explanations for what I did and why.  
   - Inserted screenshots of my terminal commands and outputs.

## ðŸ”¹ Why I Did It
- To practice **basic Linux commands** and understand the difference between **relative paths and absolute paths**.  
- To learn how to properly use **GitHub branches** for assignments, instead of working on the main branch.  
- To improve my confidence in using Linux for navigation, file management, and command-line tasks.

## ðŸ”¹ What I Learned
- How to **clone a repository** and set up a **new branch** with the correct naming convention.  
- The difference between:
  - **Relative paths** (commands depend on your current location).  
  - **Absolute paths** (commands start from the root `/`).  
- The difference between copying a **file** (Q3) and copying the **contents of a directory** (Q4).  
- How Linux uses **colors** in the terminal to indicate file types (e.g., blue = directory, yellow/green = executable).  
- How to use Git commands (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) to safely submit my work.
