INTRODUCTION TO LINUX for the Assignment1
 
 What I Did:

1. Repository Setup and Branch Management

Cloned the GitHub repository to my local machine

Created a new branch following the naming convention: 25883_Akize_Israel_assignment1

Set up the proper directory structure as per the assignment requirements

2. Directory Structure Creation

Created a complex nested directory structure under ~/tmp/Practice/

Built the following hierarchy:

Practice/
├── Else/
├── Command/
│   └── info/
└── P1/
    ├── Hi/
    │   ├── Hello/
    │   └── P3/
    │       └── Here/
    │           └── hereWeAre
    └── P2/

.Created both directories (yellow) and files (blue/black) as specified

3. Path Navigation Exercises

Practiced relative and absolute path navigation between directories

Performed file operations (copying) using different path methods

Completed all 6 questions from the Practice Paths section

4. File Operations

Used cp command to copy individual files

Used cp -r command to copy directory contents recursively

Applied both relative and absolute path approaches

       Why I Did It

1. Learning Objectives

To understand Linux file system hierarchy and navigation

To master the difference between relative and absolute paths

To develop proficiency in basic Linux commands for file management

2. Practical Application

These skills are essential for efficient system administration

Path navigation is fundamental for scripting and automation

File operations form the basis of data management in Linux environments

3. Assignment Requirements

To demonstrate competency in Linux command line operations

To show understanding of directory structures and path resolution

To prove ability to follow technical specifications accurately

        What I Learned

1. Path Navigation Skills

Relative paths use ../ to navigate up and dirname/ to navigate down from current location

Absolute paths start from root / or home ~ and specify complete location

The same destination can be reached through multiple path approaches

2. File System Understanding

Yellow color indicates directories (folders that contain other items)

Blue/Black color indicates regular files (data containers)

Directory structures can be complex but follow logical hierarchy

3. Command Proficiency

cd for changing directories with both relative and absolute paths

cp for copying files and cp -r for recursive directory copying

ls -l for detailed directory listings with path specifications

mkdir -p for creating nested directory structures efficiently

4. Problem-Solving Approach

How to analyze directory trees mentally before executing commands

The importance of verifying paths with pwd before operations

Difference between copying individual files vs. directory contents

How terminal color schemes help identify file types quickly

5. Practical Insights

Relative paths are more flexible for scripts that might run from different locations

Absolute paths are more reliable for specific, fixed operations

Understanding the current working directory is crucial for relative path operations

File system navigation is a foundational skill for advanced Linux usage

This assignment significantly improved my confidence in Linux command line operations and deepened my understanding of file system management principles.
