# Introduction_to_linux
   #  **what I did.**
   Cloned the GitHub repository to my local machine.

Created a new branch with my student ID and name.

Executed various Linux commands to navigate directories, list files, and manage files.

Took screenshots of each command output and saved them.

Compiled all commands in a file (commands.txt).

Documented my work in README.md. 
  directory action
    1. I used cd Desktop to redict me to destop where the 
home directory is located 
2.mkdir to create the directory temp on desktop
   I used the defualt home created on the desktop
3.within the Home directory I created mcbishop directory 

    I used "cd ~" to redirect to My Home derectory and used ls to make sure that the directory is created
4. within the mcbishop directory I used mkdir and created another "Practice" directory
5.I use cd mcbishop to navigate and work within the mcbishop directory and created there another diectory called "Practice"
6.I changed directory to Practice using the cd command and within the practice command I create there 3 more directories,namely; Else,command,P1.
7.within the command" directory I created the file called info.txt using "touch" command and I created 2 more directories within the the P1 directory; Hi and P2.
   I usde "cd .." to move one directory back to Practice where P1 directory is located so that I can redirect to it.
8.I navigated to Hi directry and created there a file called Hello.txt using touch command and created another directory called P3 using mkdir command.
9. I redirected to P3 directory and created there another one directory called "Here"
10.Within the "Here" directory I created a file "hereWeAre.txt" and Am Done!!!!! 

   ##   Why I did it
     To practice using Git for version control and branching.

To learn how to navigate and manipulate files in Linux.

To demonstrate my understanding of Linux commands and proper workflow.

### What I learned:
How to clone repositories and create branches in Git.

How to navigate directories and manage files using Linux commands (cd, ls, mkdir, touch, cat).

The importance of documenting commands and outputs for clarity and reproducibility.

How to structure a README to explain work clearly.
