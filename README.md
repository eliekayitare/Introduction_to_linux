## 💡 Summary  
In these exercises, I practiced **navigating directories** and **copying files** using **relative and absolute paths**.  
I learned the difference between copying **a single file** and **all files** in a directory using wildcards (`*`).  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- The difference between **relative** and **absolute** paths.  
- How to use `ls -l` for detailed listings.  
- How to copy files and directories using `cp`.  
- The importance of directory structure awareness in Linux.
