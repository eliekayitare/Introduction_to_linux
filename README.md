# \# COSC 8312 – Assignment 1: Introduction to Linux Basic Commands

# 

# \## Student Information

# \- \*\*Name:\*\* Prince Offx

# \- \*\*Student ID:\*\* 27555

# 

# ---

# 

# \## What I Did

# \- Cloned the given GitHub repository into my Windows machine using Git Bash.

# \- Created a new branch `27555\_prince\_assignment1` for my work.

# \- Recreated the required directory tree structure (`home`, `Command`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `Here`, etc.).

# \- Practiced Linux commands using \*\*relative\*\* and \*\*absolute paths\*\*:

# &nbsp; - Navigation with `cd`

# &nbsp; - Listing with `ls -l`

# &nbsp; - Copying single files with `cp`

# &nbsp; - Copying multiple files with `cp \*`

# \- Saved screenshots for each command to prove the results.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Why I Did It

# \- To practice \*\*basic Linux commands\*\* and understand how files and directories are managed.

# \- To learn the difference between \*\*relative vs absolute paths\*\* in Linux.

# \- To gain experience with \*\*Git workflow\*\* (clone, branch, commit, push) for assignments.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## What I Learned

# \- How to navigate directories and return to the home folder using different methods.

# \- The difference between copying \*\*a single file\*\* (`cp file target`) and \*\*all files inside a directory\*\* (`cp \* target`).

# \- How Linux uses colors to distinguish file types:

# &nbsp; - \*\*Blue\*\* → directories

# &nbsp; - \*\*White\*\* → regular files

# &nbsp; - \*\*Green/Yellow\*\* → executable files

# \- How to organize my work into a Git branch and push it to GitHub.

# \### Q1 – Go to Home

# \- Q1.1 (relative path) → !\[Q1.1](screenshots/1.png)

# \- Q1.2 (absolute path) → !\[Q1.2](screenshots/1.2.png)

# 

# \### Q2 – Long Listing of `Here`

# \- Q2.1 (relative path) → !\[Q2.1](screenshots/2.1.png)

# \- Q2.2 (absolute path) → !\[Q2.2](screenshots/2.2.png)

# 

# \### Q3 – Copy File `P3` to `Command`

# \- Q3.1 (from P2) → !\[Q3.1](screenshots/3.png)

# \- Q3.2 (from P3) → !\[Q3.2](screenshots/3.png)

# \- Q3.3 (from Command) → !\[Q3.3](screenshots/3.png)

# \- Q3.4 (absolute path) → !\[Q3.4](screenshots/3.png)

# 

# \### Q4 – Copy Files in P3 to `Command`

# \- Q4.1 (from P2) → !\[Q4.1](screenshots/4.1.png)

# \- Q4.2 (from P3) → !\[Q4.2](screenshots/4.2.png)

# \- Q4.3 (from Command) → !\[Q4.3](screenshots/4.3.png)

# \- Q4.4 (absolute path) → !\[Q4.4](screenshots/4.4.png)
