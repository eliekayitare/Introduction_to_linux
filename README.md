# Assignment 1 – Introduction to Linux

## What I Did
I practiced using basic Linux commands related to file navigation, listing, and copying.  
Specifically, I wrote commands to:
- Move between directories using both relative and absolute paths.
- List directory contents in long format.
- Copy files and entire directories from one place to another.
- Compare the difference between copying a single file and multiple files.
- Interpret terminal color codes for files and directories.

## Why I Did It
This assignment was designed to:
- Strengthen my understanding of Linux file system structure.
- Improve my ability to use relative vs absolute paths correctly.
- Learn practical file management commands like `ls`, `cp`, and `cd`.
- Understand the meaning of Linux terminal colors for better navigation.

## What I Learned
- **Relative vs Absolute Paths**: Relative paths depend on the current directory, while absolute paths always start from `/`.
- **Listing with `ls -l`**: The `-l` option provides detailed information about files, including permissions, ownership, and size.
- **Copying Files vs Directories**: Copying a single file is different from copying all files inside a folder (`*` wildcard is used for multiple files).
- **Terminal Colors**: Colors indicate file types — blue for directories, yellow for executables or compressed files, green for executables, and white for regular text files.
- **Best Practices**: Always double-check your path before executing commands to avoid overwriting files or copying to the wrong place.
