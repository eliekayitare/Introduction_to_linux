# Linux Assignment

##What I Did
- Cloned the assignment repository from GitHub.
- Created a new branch with the required naming convention.
- Answered all assignment questions with commands and screenshots.
- Wrote an explanation of the difference between copying one file vs. all files.
- Explained color meanings in Linux directory listings.
- Pushed my work to my branch only.

## Why I Did It
- To practice **basic Linux commands** (`cd`, `ls`, `cp`). 
- To learn the difference between **relative and absolute paths**. 
- To un1`derstand the difference between **files and directories**. 
- To practice **Git branching and pushing** to avoid affecting the main branch.

What I Learned

- How to use `ls -l` for detailed file listings. 
- How to copy one file versus multiple files. 
- The meaning of Linux terminal **color codes** (blue = directory, yellow = executable, etc.).
