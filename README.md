# Assignment 1 â€“ Introduction to Linux Basic Commands

## What I Did

- Cloned the given repository.
- Created a new branch with the correct naming format.
- Wrote and explained Linux commands for navigation (`cd`), listing (`ls -l`), and copying (`cp`).
- Differentiated relative vs absolute paths.
- Noted the meaning of terminal colors.
- Committed and pushed work only to my branch.

## Why I Did It

- To practice core Linux commands.
- To understand relative vs absolute paths.
- To learn safe file and directory management.
- To practice Git workflow with branching.

## What I Learned

- Using `cd` with both relative and absolute paths.
- Difference between copying one file vs all files.
- Terminal colors: blue = directory, yellow = executable, white = normal file.
- Importance of clear documentation and correct branch usage.
