Larger than average size: useful to flag unusually large logs or dumps.

Modified within last 72h but not 24h: captures files that may have been tampered with in a recent window.

Empty/hidden-only directories: suspicious if attackers hide tools in “hidden-only” dirs.

World-writable files: a major risk; any user can overwrite them.

Owned by other users: can reveal files that shouldn’t belong to another account.

Temporary/backup files: may contain sensitive data left unsecured.
