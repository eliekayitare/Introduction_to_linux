Question 17: Comprehensive Forensic Analysis Setup
Step 1: Directory Structure for Different File Types
bash
mkdir -p forensic/{regular_files,directories,symbolic_links,hard_links,device_files,archives}

# Regular files
echo "Regular file 1 content" > forensic/regular_files/file1.txt
echo "Regular file 2 content" > forensic/regular_files/file2.log

# Directories
mkdir forensic/directories/dir1
mkdir forensic/directories/dir2

# Symbolic links
ln -s ../regular_files/file1.txt forensic/symbolic_links/symlink_to_file1

# Hard links (must be on the same filesystem as original)
ln forensic/regular_files/file2.log forensic/hard_links/hardlink_to_file2

# Device files (requires sudo, create block and character devices, example)
sudo mknod forensic/device_files/blockdev b 7 0    # loop device
sudo mknod forensic/device_files/chardev c 1 3     # null device

# Set permission examples
chmod 4755 forensic/regular_files/file1.txt    # setuid
chmod 2755 forensic/regular_files/file2.log    # setgid
chmod 1777 forensic/directories/dir1            # sticky bit on directory
Step 2: Setting Different Ownerships
bash
# Change ownership (use existing users or create dummy users)
sudo chown root:root forensic/regular_files/file1.txt
sudo chown nobody:nogroup forensic/regular_files/file2.log
sudo chown $USER:$USER forensic/directories/dir2
Step 3: Create Different Archives with Compression Methods
bash
cd forensic/regular_files

# tar + gzip
tar -czf ../archives/regular_files.tar.gz *

# tar + bzip2
tar -cjf ../archives/regular_files.tar.bz2 *

# tar + xz
tar -cJf ../archives/regular_files.tar.xz *

# zip
zip -r ../archives/regular_files.zip *
Step 4: Commands to Analyze Each Element
List file types with ls -l and file:

bash
ls -l forensic/*
file forensic/regular_files/*
Check symbolic links:

bash
ls -l forensic/symbolic_links
readlink forensic/symbolic_links/symlink_to_file1
Check device files:

bash
ls -l forensic/device_files
file forensic/device_files/*
Check permissions and special bits:

bash
ls -l --color=auto forensic/regular_files
lsattr forensic/regular_files/*
Check ownerships:

bash
ls -l forensic/regular_files
stat forensic/regular_files/file1.txt
Verify archives:

bash
tar -tf forensic/archives/regular_files.tar.gz
unzip -l forensic/archives/regular_files.zip


Commands Used
Creation commands: mkdir, touch, ln, mknod, chmod, chown

Analysis commands: ls -l, file, readlink, stat, tar, unzip

Permission and metadata checks help in forensic investigation and monitoring.
