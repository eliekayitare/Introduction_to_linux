Question 14: Troubleshooting User Access Issues
Step 1: Analyze Current User Context and Groups
Run these commands:

bash
# Current user details
whoami

# Current user's groups
groups

# Another user's groups (e.g., user2)
groups user2
Compare group memberships to see differences in access rights.

Step 2: Examine /etc/passwd for System vs Regular Users
bash
cat /etc/passwd
System users usually:

Have UIDs below 1000 (on many distros)

Have no login shells (e.g., /sbin/nologin or /bin/false)

Used for system services (e.g., daemon, bin, sys)

Regular users usually:

Have UIDs 1000 and above

Have valid login shells (e.g., /bin/bash)

Have home directories in /home

Example:

text
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash             # System user - root
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin  # System user
alice:x:1001:1001:Alice:/home/alice:/bin/bash    # Regular user
Step 3: Create Test Scenario and Compare Groups
bash
# Create a test regular user
sudo useradd testuser -m -s /bin/bash

# Check groups of testuser
groups testuser

# Try adding testuser to system groups like 'adm' or 'sys'
sudo usermod -aG adm testuser

# Verify access changes
groups testuser
Step 4: Potential Security Implications
Regular users with system group memberships may gain unintended elevated privileges, risking:

Access to system logs, sensitive files

Ability to modify system services or binaries

Bypass security policies or auditing

Principle of least privilege must be enforced: users get only required access for their role.

Summary
System users differ from regular users by UID range, shell, and intended purpose.

Group memberships control access; mixing system groups with regular users can be a vulnerability.

Always verify user groups and apply least privilege principle.

Use /etc/passwd, groups, and user management commands to audit and troubleshoot access issues.
