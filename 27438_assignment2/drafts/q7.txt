Although both files had the same visible text, they were treated differently because of line endings.

diff reported every line as different, since it saw \n vs \r\n.

cmp found the first differing byte position (extra \r in CRLF).

comm considered the lines different entirely, since the hidden carriage return made the strings mismatch.

Lesson: Cross-platform compatibility issues arise when files are edited across Linux and Windows.
 Config files or scripts may break because of incorrect line endings. The safe practice is to normalize files using tools like dos2unix, unix2dos, or Gitâ€™s core.autocrlf setting.
